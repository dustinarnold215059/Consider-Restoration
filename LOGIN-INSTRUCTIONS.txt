LOGIN TEST INSTRUCTIONS
======================

To test the user login persistence:

1. OPEN USER PORTAL:
   - Open: user-portal.html
   - Try logging in with one of these test accounts:

2. WORKING TEST ACCOUNT (VERIFIED):
   Email: test@example.com
   Password: test123
   
3. OTHER TEST ACCOUNTS (may need password verification):
   Email: john.doe@email.com
   Password: user123
   
   Email: jane.smith@email.com  
   Password: user123

4. ADMIN ACCOUNT (for admin panel):
   Email: admin@considerrestoration.com
   Password: admin123

4. TESTING STEPS:
   a) Login with one of the test accounts
   b) Navigate to different pages (index.html, services.html, about.html)
   c) Check if the navigation shows "My Account" instead of "Login"
   d) Verify the session persists across page navigation
   
5. LOGGED-IN USER FEATURES TO TEST:
   a) BOOKING PAGE: User details auto-populate (name, email, phone)
   b) MEMBERSHIP PAGE: Buttons show "Join Now - [User Name]" 
   c) REVIEWS PAGE: Review form becomes available, name used automatically
   d) ALL PAGES: Navigation shows "My Account" instead of "Login"

5. DEBUGGING:
   - Open browser console (F12) to see login debugging messages
   - Look for messages starting with üîí for authentication
   - Look for messages starting with üç™ for cookie session management

6. TROUBLESHOOTING:
   - If login button becomes unresponsive, wait 10 seconds for timeout
   - Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
   - Try refreshing the page and logging in again

The login should now work and persist across pages using the new cookie-based session management system.
